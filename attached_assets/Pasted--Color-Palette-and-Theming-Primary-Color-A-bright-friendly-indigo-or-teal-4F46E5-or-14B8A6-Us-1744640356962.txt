 Color Palette and Theming
Primary Color: A bright, friendly indigo or teal (#4F46E5 or #14B8A6)

Used for the header background, button highlights, and key accent elements (like the “+ Add Habit” button).

Secondary Color: A complementary purple or lighter teal (#6366F1 or #5EEAD4)

Used for badges, progress bars, or hover states.

Success/Completion: A vibrant green (#22C55E)

Used for checkmarks, completed items, streak indicators.

Warning/Partial Completion: A yellow or orange (#FACC15 or #F97316)

Used for partial completion or “in-progress” states.

Danger/Uncompleted: A red (#EF4444)

Used sparingly, only to indicate missed habits or reset streak.

Background: Light neutral gray or off-white (#F3F4F6) for sections, with pure white (#FFFFFF) cards for content blocks.

Text Colors:

Primary text: Dark gray (#111827 or #1F2937)

Secondary text (subdued notes or labels): Medium gray (#6B7280)

This color scheme ensures accessible contrast and draws attention to important actions (e.g., marking habits done, adding new habits).

3. Typographic Hierarchy
Headings: Large, bold, and legible (e.g., [Font: Inter or Open Sans], Size ~24–28px for top headings).

Section Subtitles: Slightly smaller (18–20px) with medium weight.

Body Text: ~14–16px with regular weight.

Secondary/Helper Text: ~12–14px with lighter color.

Button Text: Bold, ~14–16px, with enough padding for large hit areas.

4. Spacing and Layout
Use generous padding around sections (24–32px).

Segment content using soft divider lines or card containers.

Group related metrics (like “Total Habits,” “Today’s Progress,” etc.) in a card or row of boxes for quick scanning.

Align visual elements carefully: keep icon + text combos in a single row, with consistent spacing between them.

Make the “Add Habit” button stand out with the primary brand color and a clear label, always visible on the screen so users can add habits anytime.

5. Interaction and Microcopy
Hover States & Clickable Elements:

Use subtle color or shadow changes to let users know an element (like the “Edit” icon) is clickable.

Tooltips / Info Icons:

For more advanced metrics (like “Today’s Progress” or “Streaks”), add a small “i” info icon with an explanation.

Mark as Complete:

Single-click or tap checkmark to mark a habit as completed. Use a neat check animation (e.g., a brief pop or color fill) for positive reinforcement.

Error/Warning States:

If a habit was missed, show a subtle highlight or a small message “You missed this habit yesterday” or “Streak ended.”

6. HCD Considerations
Clear, Concise Labels:

Use plain language (“Add Habit,” “Mark Complete”) rather than ambiguous icons alone.

Consistency & Familiar Patterns:

Keep the same icon or color usage for “complete” across the app.

Accessibility:

Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA or above).

Allow keyboard navigation with visible focus states.

Confirmation & Feedback:

Show a quick success toast when a habit is marked complete or created.

Provide an undo option for accidental actions.

Progress Visibility:

Large, easy-to-understand progress bars and streak counters.

Encourage positive reinforcement (e.g., “You’ve done great 3 days in a row!”).
